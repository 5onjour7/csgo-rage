# Internal CS:GO rage cheat ![CS:GO](https://img.shields.io/badge/game-CS%3AGO-orange?style=flat)

Made using [digital sdk](https://github.com/W1lliam1337/digital-sdk/tree/master) as a base.

This was made for me to learn game hacking, to eventually create a CS2 rage hack.

Most of this is selfcoded except for the parts of code from the digital sdk.
